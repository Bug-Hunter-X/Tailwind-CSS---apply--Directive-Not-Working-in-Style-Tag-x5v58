This issue is caused by the use of Tailwind's `@apply` directive within a style tag. The `@apply` directive is designed to be used within the main CSS file or other CSS files imported into the main CSS file.  When used within a style tag, it is often ignored by Tailwind's build process, leading to classes not being applied.  

```html
<style>
  .my-element {
    @apply bg-blue-500 text-white;
  }
</style>

<div class="my-element">This text should be blue and white.</div>
```
